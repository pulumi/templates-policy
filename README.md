# Templates Policy

This repo contains the templates for `pulumi policy new`, which make it easy to quickly get started building new Pulumi projects.

For more on Policy visit the [Pulumi Policy SDK repo](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-policy).

## Adding a New Template

1. Create a new directory for the template, e.g. my-template-javascript. By convention, hyphens are used to separate words and the language is included as a suffix.

1. Add template files in the new directory.
